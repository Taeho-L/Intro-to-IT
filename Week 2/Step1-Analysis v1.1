# Problem and Outcomes

The university wants to create a smart parking barrier system at its main gate that:
  - Automatically open the barrier for registered staff and students.
  - Count the number of cars in the parking lot.
  - Display the number of available spots.
  - Trigger an alert if someone tries to enter when the parking lot is full.

The goal is to simulate and implement the logic using the Integrated Problem-Solving Process.

Goal - To design a smart parking barrier system based on number of cars and parking lots.

Constraints - 

## Inputs
Entry of Car - from entry gate
Exit of Car - from exit gate
Registered Personel - from card scanner

## Outputs
Alert if full - from entry gate
Open/close barrier for registered personel - from gates
Parking Spot Measure - from number of car

## Constant
Total Parking Spots

## Assumptions
Registration database is up to date
Each vehicle takes up one parking space.

## Expected Outcome
Registered personel with available parking lot --> Granted Entry
Registered personel without available parking lot --> Alert, No Entry
Unregistered personel --> Alert, No Entry

Max Capacity | Constant | 100 vehicles
Car Count | Variable | 75 vehicles
Barrier Control | Output | Open/Close
Alert | Output | On/Off
Registration | Decision | Yes/No
Display | Output | 25 spots available
Card Scanner | Input | u3309136
