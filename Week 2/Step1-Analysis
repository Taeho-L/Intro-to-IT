# Problem and Outcomes

The university wants to create a smart parking barrier system at its main gate that:
  - Automatically open the barrier for registered staff and students.
  - Count the number of cars in the parking lot.
  - Display the number of available spots.
  - Trigger an alert if someone tries to enter when the parking lot is full.

The goal is to simulate and implement the logic using the Integrated Problem-Solving Process.

Goal - To design a smart parking barrier system based on number of cars and parking lots.
